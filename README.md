# RainTale - A 2D charcter animation test

Initially I had the idea to create an 2D platformer about the gloomy but wonderous adventures of the little girl Aomame.
I the end it became only a test for creating an animated character from self made assets. Maybe her story will be told one day...but probably in 3D.
